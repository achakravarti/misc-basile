This is a tiny set of files to help a tutorial by phone on [GNU
make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). It is two variants of a
hello world program (one is a single file `helloworld1.c`, another is
a two files `hello2.c` and `world2.c` with a common header
`helloworld2.h`). There are three makefiles: `Makefile1`,
`Makefile2plain` and `Makefile2timestamp` (the later showing a
generated `timestamp2.c` file with auto-dependencies).

I am not sure if it is correct to use the GPLv3+ license for such a
trivial example.
